# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.1.24.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **BlueZ (HA OS) pairing: register a temporary pairing agent** — BlueZ only makes an adapter bondable while a default `org.bluez.Agent1` is registered (`AlwaysPairable` is off on HA OS), so the kernel refused the Peak's SMP pairing: the PUP bond-trigger read timed out and `pair()` failed with `AuthenticationFailed` in ~100 ms. On a local BlueZ adapter the integration now registers a short-lived auto-accept agent (`KeyboardDisplay`, accepts only the Peak's own device path) around the bond trigger and `pair()`, then unregisters it. ESPHome proxies, macOS and Windows are unaffected; any D-Bus failure is logged and ignored.

## [1.1.24] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **ESPHome / BlueZ Lorax bond** — after `bond=none` leaves GET_LIMITS / auth silent (`Insufficient authentication`), retry with an explicit OS `pair()` while the Peak is in pairing mode. HA connect heal path now clears a stale bond only after plain reconnect fails.

## [1.1.23] - 2026-08-31

### Improved

- **Keep link while Peak is visible** — idle disconnect is skipped while the Peak is still advertising, and after an idle GATT release the coordinator reconnects immediately if the device is still in range (no more waiting on the 15s tick or toggling lantern to force a reconnect).
- **Link status sensor** — always-on `sensor.*_link_status` reports `connected` / `awake` / `asleep` for dashboards.

## [1.1.22] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Never call `pair()` on BlueZ** — the Peak aborts SMP and drops the link when the central initiates pairing, reproducible in bare `bluetoothctl` with a `NoInputNoOutput` agent and no host bond. The Android `triggerBond` read (Silabs OTA app-version characteristic) is just as fatal, killing the GATT link in ~3s. Neither is needed: the Lorax command and reply characteristics carry no encryption flags (`write-without-response` / `notify`), so Linux now falls back across subscription modes instead of trying to bond. A bond is still established out of band, by the OS, before the integration connects.
- **Handshake order now matches the reference client** — subscribe to both Lorax notification characteristics *before* reading the protocol version and issuing any command. Commands sent before the reply/event CCCDs are live get no reply.
- **Dropped the sticky handle prune from init** — `PRUNE_FILE_HANDLES` is absent from the reference client's opcode table, and sending it cost a 15s timeout before `GET_LIMITS` was even attempted.
- **Misleading connection errors** — the handshake retry loop now reports the first failure instead of the last. Once the link is down, every later step reported a downstream symptom (`Service Discovery has not been performed yet`, `Lorax service missing from GATT discovery`) that hid the real cause. GATT discovery also distinguishes an already-dropped link from a genuinely absent Lorax service.
- **Entry title no longer includes signal strength** — picking a device from the config flow dropdown used the picker label as the entry title, so every entity ended up named `… · -36 dBm`.

## [1.1.21] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **BlueZ pairing** — do not call `pair()` before the Lorax handshake on Linux, and do not auto-unpair on a failed connect. Explicit `pair()` after GATT is up was returning `AuthenticationFailed` and dropping the link; wiping the host bond then left the Peak with mismatched keys.

## [1.1.12] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Switch and climate registration** — use the same coordinator + platform base MRO as buttons so Heater and Heat session / Stealth entities register reliably after reload.

## [1.1.11] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Setup crash** — `PuffcoButtonBase` referenced `ButtonEntity` in `entity.py` without importing it, breaking all platform loading.

## [1.1.10] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **“No longer provided by the integration”** — reload/unload crashed because `async_shutdown` called a non-existent parent method; buttons and other entities were orphaned after reload.
- **Button entity registration** — session buttons use a proper `PuffcoButtonBase` MRO again.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Stuck BLE connection** — releases the GATT link after ~3 minutes idle so the Peak can sleep; stops the 2s keepalive probe that was preventing disconnect.
- **Reconnect loop** — no longer hammers reconnect when the Peak is asleep (only reconnects on wake adverts), avoiding the “needs pairing mode” recovery trap.
- **Stale link detection** — clears the connected flag when the GATT session is gone but no disconnect callback fired.

### Added

- **Idle disconnect** integration option (on by default) — disable to keep a persistent connection like before.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Diagnostic entities unavailable** — coordinator stays available with cached data while the Peak is connected (not advertising) or asleep; diagnostic binary sensors use the same persistent availability as other read-only entities.
- **Diagnostics after enable** — entities push cached state when enabled, and turning on “Show diagnostic entities” in integration options re-enables them in the entity registry.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Reload / remove** — `async_shutdown` now calls the parent coordinator shutdown so interval and reconnect timers stop cleanly.
- **Wake-on-command** — the 5s “wait for Peak to wake” no longer holds the BLE lock, so polls and other commands are not blocked during the wait.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Button press crash** — logbook calls used the wrong argument order (`name` / `message` swapped), which broke start session and other actions that log to the logbook.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`binary_sensor.*_awake`** — shows when the Peak is awake (advertising or connected).
- **Stale-data attributes** — sensors expose `data_stale`, `last_seen`, and `awake` when the Peak is sleeping.
- **Wake-on-command** (optional, on by default) — waits up to 5s for the Peak to advertise before failing a command.

### Changed

- **Controllable entities** (switch, climate, lights, numbers, etc.) go **unavailable** while the Peak is asleep; read-only sensors keep their last value.
- **Session controls** stay available during an active heat timer even if BLE drops briefly.
- **Faster reconnect** when the Peak is already advertising (shorter wake delay).

## [1.1.4] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Faster commands to the Peak** — start/stop, boost, stealth, and other writes preempt in-flight BLE polls and reconnects instead of queuing behind them. State refresh after writes runs in the background so the GATT command goes out immediately.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Faster session start** — switch, timer, and session events update immediately after the start command; BLE sync runs in the background instead of blocking up to ~4s.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Reconnect reliability** — automatic stale-bond healing (unpair + fresh GATT) when the Lorax handshake fails after sleep, instead of requiring delete/re-add. Reconnect worker no longer bails on the first “not visible” attempt and retries up to 8 times.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Device picker + active BLE scan** during setup — no longer jumps straight to manual MAC entry when nothing is cached. Choose **Scan for devices…** (15s active scan) or pick from already-discovered Peaks.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Boost** — `button.*_boost_session`, `puffco.boost_session` service (during active heat only).
- **Boost presets** — `number.*_profile_N_boost_temp` / `boost_time` per profile.
- **Profile LED color** — `light.*_profile_N_color` (RGB ring color per profile).
- **Profile name** — `text.*_profile_N_name` (read/write).
- **Lantern brightness** — `number.*_lantern_brightness` plus lantern light syncs from device.
- **4-segment LED brightness** — ring / glass / main / battery number entities.
- **Chamber type** — enum sensor (`classic`, `performance`, `xl`, etc.).
- **Diagnostics** — approx dabs remaining, device birthday, uptime, total heat time.
- **Serial number** — written to the HA device registry on full poll.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Stealth mode** switch now updates reliably on Lorax firmware: 1-byte write (was 4-byte), cached state after writes, and optimistic UI refresh so polls cannot snap the switch back.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Session finished** / idle events now fire when the cycle ends (session guard no longer blocks real idle transitions; local timer fires `finished` at zero).
- **Charging / dock** — binary sensor is on for any dock state (bulk, topup, full), not only active charge; dock placement fires `charging_started` reliably.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`switch.*_heat_session`** — clear on/off for start vs abort (better than climate heat/off).

### Fixed

- Climate **Heat/Off** now matches session state (uses local timer + BLE), always sends abort on off, and skips duplicate starts.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Real-time session countdown** — when a heat session starts, a local 1-second timer runs so `heat_time_remaining` and `heat_cycle_timer` tick smoothly even when BLE polls fail. Re-syncs from the device when reads succeed. `finishes_at` is included on session-started events.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Entities no longer go **Unknown** mid-session when the Peak hits target temp: resilient fast-polling keeps last good values if BLE reads fail during active heat.
- Ignore spurious idle operating-state reads while the session timer has not finished.
- Do not disconnect or drop cached state on poll failures during an active heat cycle.
- All entities stay available while cached session data exists.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Heat timers show **0** when idle instead of **Unknown**; `active` attribute indicates session state.
- Session events and entity updates no longer blocked when device registry update fails.
- After starting a session, poll until the Peak reports heat-cycle state so timers and events update.
- Ignore NaN elapsed/total timer reads from the device.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Fix `climate.set_hvac_mode` / session start failing on Home Assistant 2026.x: `async_update_device()` no longer accepts `connections=` (removed redundant update; model/firmware still refresh).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Fix config flow import failure caused by invalid `PuffcoData` dataclass field ordering (`battery_percent` and other required fields were declared after optional fields).

### Documentation

- Remove machine-specific paths (`z:\OneDrive\...`, `Existing-Integration/`) and personal MAC references from docs and examples.
- Dashboard YAMLs use `DEVICE_SLUG` placeholder; see new [docs/DASHBOARDS.md](docs/DASHBOARDS.md).
- Fix `sync_ha_lib` scripts to copy into `_vendor/puffco_ble/` (was pointing at a non-existent path).
- Generalize [PUBLISH.md](docs/PUBLISH.md) for ongoing releases after the initial push.
